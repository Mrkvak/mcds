2014-03-07  Timothy Brown  <tbrown@freeshell.org>

	Bug fix (malloc incorrect brackets).
	Bug fix in argument parsing routine. I had the +1 inside of the
	call to strlen().

	Also changed the default value of the curl error code to be CURLE_OK
	instead of 0.

2014-03-07  Timothy Brown  <tbrown@freeshell.org>

	Bug fix in carddav.
	Bug fix in terminating the response string. I was under allocting the
	array by 1.

	Adding a sanity check in the rc parsing.
	Putting in a break to make sure we only parse the first two
	tokens in a rc file.

	Adding the ability to read a configuration file.

2014-03-06  Timothy Brown  <tbrown@freeshell.org>

	Code clean up. Adding C99 standard.
	Adding the C99 standard for autoconf and the removal of unused
	variables in the source.

	Bugfix. Renaming function.
	Missed a rename of the xml walk_nodes to walk_tree function.

	Merge branch 'master' of https://code.freeshell.org/mcds

	Split the parsing into xml and regex.
	Decided to bite the bullet and use libxml to do the initial parsing
	of the carddav data received. Then when a vcard is found, pass it
	off to a regex parser.

2014-03-05  Timothy Brown  <tbrown@freeshell.org>

	Upping the revision number.

	Updated the output to conform to mutt.

2014-03-05  Timothy Brown  <tbrown@freeshell.org>

	Adding the ability to print the full name.
	The mutt query command expects the results along the lines of:
		Searching database ... 20 entries ... 3 matching:
		me@cs.hmc.edu           Michael Elkins  mutt dude
		blong@fiction.net       Brandon Long    mutt and more
		roessler@guug.de        Thomas Roessler mutt pgp

	That is a one line message, then each matching response on a single
	line, each line containing a tab separated address then name then
	some other optional information. On error, or if there are no
	matching addresses, return a non-zero exit code and a one line
	error message.

2014-03-05  Timothy Brown  <tbrown@freeshell.org>

	Updated manpage.
	I had left in a reference to tbrown as the user in the carddav url.

	Removing main.h from the src/Makefile.am
	There is no main.h yet I had left it in the source automake
	file.

	Moving the ChangeLog to the toplevel directory.

	Email query is working.
	The email query/regex is working. However addresses still need to
	be re-parsed.

	Possibly need to check how mutt wants the query returned as.

2014-03-04  Timothy Brown  <tbrown@freeshell.org>
